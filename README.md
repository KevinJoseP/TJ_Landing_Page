TJ Distributors is a small-scale Aluminium/Steel Utensils and Kitchenware distribution company

## Courtesies 
Currently working as a backend software engineer, this is also my first attempt to build a professional
website starting from scratch. First of all, thanks a ton TJ Distributors for entrusting me with this job.
Even after knowing that I do not have much experience in front-end, you gave me enough time to iterate over
the shortcomings and deliver the first iteration in a span of a week. Thanks a lot and I will keep on working
on the rest of the deliverables as per the proposed timeline.
